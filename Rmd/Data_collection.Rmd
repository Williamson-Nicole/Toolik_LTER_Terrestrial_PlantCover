# Sites

# When?  

* Plant cover should be estimated around "peak green" (when plants are at their greenest)
* This typically occurs in mid July but can vary year to year depending on if it is an early or late spring

# Supplies 

* Two or more 1 m^2 quadrats divided into 25 (20x20cm) subquadrats: constructed out of PVC and string 
  * typically located under the lab
* Data sheets (*Download file below*)
  * Print on *Rite in the Rain* paper (*must use a laser printer for this or the ink wont dry**)
* Clipboard and pencil

# Feild measurments  

* There is an 8m long transect in each plot where we measure plant cover each year
  * 1 m^2 quadrats are placed side by side down this transect
  *Typically we use 2-3 qudrants at a time and work in teams of 3-4 (2-3 observers and/or 1-2 recorders)  
  
  
  
* To estimate plant cover do your best to get a birds-eye view of the quadrant
* One 20x20cm sub square represents about % 4 of the area of the quadrant 
* Using this as a guide you will estimate the % area of the plot a given species makes up. Typically it is easiest to go square by square and add up as you go  

**! Calibration !**

An important step before you start recording data is to **"Calibrate"** with the other observers to make sure you are all getting around the same numbers
