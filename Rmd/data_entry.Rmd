# Data entry template

Download and use the template below to enter data 

**Do not edit column names or add any new ones**  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
xfun::embed_file('../Data/Data_entry_template.csv', text = 'Download TEMPLATE here')
``` 

  **See an example of how to enter data into this template below**
  
  - This example show data entered from 3 different plots; Block 1 GHNP, Block 1 CT, and Block 2 GHNP  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
xfun::embed_file('../Data/Test_data.csv', text = 'Download EXAMPLE here')
``` 

# Naming conventions
**Be mindful of naming conventions: See tables below** 

- Sites: all uppercase letters 
- Treatments: naming conventions should be all uppercase, no spaces, or any other symbols
- Species: we use three letter codes for genus and species. The first letter of genus code should be capitalized, everything else lower case

**FULL LIST OF TREATMENT & SITE NAMING CONVENTIONS**  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
xfun::embed_file('../Data/Site_Treatment_codes.csv', text = 'Download SITE/TREATMENT LIST here')
``` 

**FULL LIST OF SPECIES NAMING CONVENTIONS**  
```{r, echo=FALSE}
xfun::embed_file('../Data/SpeciesList_naming_conventions.csv', text = 'Download SPECIES LIST here')
```

# Naming convention erros 
**Be mindful of common naming convention errors!**
*For all columns, but especially treatment and species names*

- extra spaces (EX: `"Bet nan"` vs `"Bet nan "` will be read in as a unique species name)
- periods (EX: `"St. D. Bet"` vs `"St. D Bet"` will be read in as a unique species name)
- capitalization (EX: `"Bet nan"` vs `"Bet Nan"` vs `"bet nan"` will all be read in as unique species names)
- spelling errors


# Entering cover values: 

- Should be entered as a decimal (ex: 25% cover should be entered as 0.25)
- **If a species isn't present then enter "0"** DO NOT LEAVE BLANK, or enter any other symbols or values
  - exampled of things **not to enter:** `"NA"`, `"-"`, `"none"`

**Leave a blank row separating data from one plot to another.** In the "date" column, type "drop"

- again be mindful of spaces and capitalization. (AKA do not type `"Drop"`, `"drop "`, or `"DROP"`)
